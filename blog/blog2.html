                    <p>These first couple of weeks have been an amazing ride. Do read my first blog summarizing my project and 
                    objectives <i><a href="https://ayush1999.github.io/blog/blog1.html">here</a></i>. In the 
                    following blog, I'm going to summarize my work, the objectives I completed successfully and the work that 
                    still remains to be done in this regard.


                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Objectives completed:</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        Most of my time during these weeks was spend on writing operator tests for the ONNX ops. I successfully
                        wrote about 60 tests for different operators. One big hurdle I was able to overcome was the poor performance 
                        of models. I realized the source of this error after I came across a few discrepancies in the tests, and fixed 
                         them asap. I got to learn a lot in this process, as I wasn't used to writing tests before.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><p>
                        The second big achievement was loading quite a few ONNX models into Flux. I was able to load the <i>SqueezeNet, 
                        DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG19, ZfNet, GoogleNet</i> into <i>Flux</i>. While most of the models except for <i>GoogleNet</i> and 
                        <i>ZfNet</i> had a pretty good performance (the <i>VGG19</i> actually had a slightly better performance that the <i>VGG19</i> currently
                        hosted on <i>Metalhead.jl</i>), I came across a few legacy issues in a few models. <br>
                        The <i>GoogleNet</i> and <i>ZfNet</i> models had Local Response Normalization layers, which <i>Flux</i> currently doesn't support. 
                        So, I had to manually bypass this entire layer. As a result, the performance was affected. <br>
                        Quite a few models used asymmetric padding. As advised by my mentors, I used to convert most of the asymmetric
                         paddings into symmetric ones, with a little depreciation in performance. For example, padding of the form 
                         (0,0,2,2) was implemented as (1,1,1,1). This was fine as far as a few models were concerned, but many showed 
                         asymmetric padding which cannot be converted to symmetric ones, without changing the expected output shape.
                         For example, changing (0,0,1,1) to symmetric padding isn't possible. The only way around this would be to introduce
                        support for asymmetric padding in <i>Flux</i>.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><p>
                        I got to learn a lot in this process. I found errors in a few <i>ONNX</i> models and I opened issues in the 
                        respective <i>ONNX</i> repositories (<a href="https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/created_by/ayush1999">here</a>). 
                        I also encountered an error in <i>Flux</i> layers, which was changing the type of output as
                        compared to the input. The issue I raised in <i>Flux</i> can be found <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl/issues/260">here</a>.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><p>
                        I also opened a Pull Request in <i>FluxML/Metalhead.jl</i>, where I added four more models to the Metalhead repository. The PR can 
                        be found <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Metalhead.jl/pull/6">here</a>.
                    </p></li>

                    <p>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Objectives for the next two weeks:</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p> Implementing Local Response Normalization (LRN) in  Flux. I'm currently working on this and implementing it by referring 
                        to the research paper by <i>Krizhevsky et al</i>, which can be found <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/imagenet.pdf">here</a>.
                    </p></li>

                    <li><p>
                        <i>Keras.jl</i>: I have already begun work on this (<a href="https://github.com/ayush1999/Keras.jl">here</a>). Rather than generating code, 
                        (like <i>ONNX.jl</i> does), I'm working on 
                        loading <i>Keras</i> models directly into <i>Flux</i>. I've been able to get the <i>MNIST</i> classifier loaded into <i>Flux</i>. The current 
                        impediments in this domain include increasing performance of the models. The <i>MNIST</i> model loaded doesn't have a good 
                        accuray, so I need to investigate the reason behind this. Also, once I get this running for <i>MNIST</i>, I will expand 
                        its functionalities to include other complicated models.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <i>ONNX.jl</i> models: The <i>ONNX</i> models repository is updated frequently. As soon as the correct models are updated, I 
                        will resume testing and loading them into <i>Flux</i>.
                    </p></li>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion: </h2>

                    <p>
                        The next few weeks are certainly going to test my programming skills. However, I'd like to thank my mentor, 
                        <a href="https://github.com/philtomson">Phil Tomson</a> for taking time out from his schedule to help me and for his continuous support and guidance. 
                        I'm pretty confident that I would be able to meet most of the objectives under his supervision. 
                        <br>
                        Hoping for the best!
                    </p>
