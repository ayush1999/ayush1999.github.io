            <p>Machine learning is revolutionizing the entire tech industry. Ever since the advent of deep learning, we've seen extraordinary changes in the field of Computer Vision and Natural language processing. Computers can now successfully understand images, detect objects from image and so on.
              lol
            </p>

            <p>But, here's the problem. There are many Deep Learning libraries available for implementing neural networks. TensorFlow, CNTK, PyTorch, Caffe, MXNet, 
              CoreML. This just multiplies the troubles. Each framework has its own functioning. Some use Computation graphs, some are completely
              dynamic.So here's the question engineers have been trying to solve: <br> <b> Is it possible to develop a framework that helps us in 
                running a model made using framework X into anther framework Y? </b>
            </p>

            <p>The answer to that question is Yes, it is possible. It is possible to train an model completely in Caffe and then load and run it completely in PyTorch. The reason behind this is <a href="https://onnx.ai">onnx</a>. 
              ONNX is a framework for interchangeable machine learning models. It uses Google's Protocol Buffers to serialize models into a common onnx format, and a set of 
              specifications to read it into another framework.
            </p>

            <p>Although ONNX is currently in its development stage, it shows great promise. It has earned kudos from varoius data scientists and Machine 
              leanrning practisioners alike. It makes transfer learning cross platform, which is amazing. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">My Project</h2>
<p> There was a time when I used to use Python for all data science related work. Now, I can easily say that I'm drifting towards Julia.
  Julia is slowly becong the mainstream for data scientists, economists, software engineers alike. This comes aas no surprise, seeing how easy and dynamic the langauge is,
  the wonders that even a few lines of Julia code can do (yes, fewer than Python :)) even while achieving amazing results on the clock.   
  These qualities make it a perfect langauge for Machine Learning. 
</p>

<p>For those who don't know, <a href="http://fluxml.ai/"> Flux</a> is a purely Julian ML framework. It provides an elegant, easy-to-hack approach for implementing Deep learning
  models. Coding networks in Flux is essentially as simple as writing mathematical equations. </p>
  My project revolves around developing an ONNX backend for the Julia Flux framework. This would help us

  1. Load diverse models into Flux.
  2. Help in growing Flux as a complete framework, by incorporating functionalities from other framweorks.
  3. Object detection in Julia, something I'm really excited about.

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
