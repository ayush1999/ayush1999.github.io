                    <p>The previous few weeks involved working on <i>ONNX.jl</i> and <i>Keras.jl</i>. I came across various challenges,
                        errors, but was able to surpass most of them. I got to learn a lot in this process, about Julia's infrastructure, 
                        Keras, Flux and Machine learning in general. In this blog, I'm going to summarize my work, mostly on Keras.jl, since I
                        spent a major chunk of my time on it. Incase you haven't,
                        please do read the first two blogs <a href="https://ayush1999.github.io/blog/index.html">here</a>. 
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><a href="https://github.com/ayush1999/Keras.jl">Keras.jl</a></h2>
                    <p> A major portion of my time was spent on <a href="https://github.com/ayush1999/Keras.jl"><i>Keras.jl</i></a>. Keras.jl 
                        is a package built on top of the Flux machine learning framework, to directly run <i>Keras</i> pretrained models in <i>Flux</i>.
                        This is done by converting the entire <i>Keras</i> model into a Julian format. When a <i>Keras</i> (running either <i>TensorFlow</i> or 
                        <i>Theano</i> backend) model is compiled, it actually forms a computation graph. In layman's terms, Computation graphs can
                        be thought of as a regular graph, but with each node representing layers and the edges representing the flow of tensors
                        (hence the name <i>TensorFlow</i>). <i>Keras.jl</i> interprets this graph and converts it into pure Julia code (using <i>DataFlow.jl</i>), 
                        by reading the weights and other parameters of the model at each step. As a result, what we get is a Julian
                        representation of the model. This can then be directly run on top of <i>Flux</i>, with appropriate inputs.<br><br>
                        <i>Keras.jl</i> also provides a simple and easy-to-use interface. Loading and running a <i>Keras</i> is model is as simple as:<br>
                        <pre>
 >>> using Keras

 >>> model = Keras.load("model_structure.json", "model_weights.h5")

 >>> model(...)
                        </pre>
                        <br>
                        (<i>model_structure</i> is the structure of the model, in JSON format.)<br>
                        (<i>model_weights</i> stores the weights of the model, in HDF5 format.)<br>
                        These fields can be obtained from any Keras model, using <i>model.to_json()</i> and <i>model.save_weights()</i>
                        respectively.
                    </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Computer Vision based models:</h2>

                    <p>
                        I was able to load most of the popular Vision based Keras models into Flux. These models include:<br><br>
                        <i>
                        I. Inception Netv3<br>
                        II. DenseNet 121<br>
                        II. DenseNet 121<br>
                        III. DenseNet 169<br>
                        IV. DenseNet 201<br>
                        V. ResNet50</i>
                        <br><br>
                        Most of the loaded models has pretty good accuracies (at par with the original ones).
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Natural Language Processing related models:</h2>
                    <p>I spent a major chunk of my time working on loading NLP related models. I implemented and loaded three
                        NLP models:<br><br>

                        <strong>I. IMDb sentiment analysis:</strong><br>
                        The model was trained on the IMDb sentiment analysis dataset, which contains 25,000 movie reviews and
                        the sentiment (0/1) associated with them. The Keras model showed a 87.25% accuracy, and the corresponding 
                        loaded Flux models showed a 87.2% accuracy (pretty good result). The model also showed good results when 
                        tested on user input:
                        <br><br>
                        <pre>
 >>> model("It was such a waste of time")
 0

 >>> model("such amazing stuff")
 1
                        </pre><br>
                        The example, along with instructions, can be found <u><a href="https://github.com/ayush1999/Keras.jl/tree/master/examples/imdb%20sentiment%20analysis">here</a></u>.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>I. Reuters topic classification:</strong><br>
                        The dataset contains 11,228 newswires from Reuters, labeled over 46 topics. Each wire is encoded as a sequence
                        of word indexes.<br> To know more, have a look at <u><a href="https://github.com/ayush1999/Keras.jl/tree/master/examples/reuters%20topic%20classification">this</a></u>.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>I. Text Generation using LSTMs:</strong>
                        <br> Text generation, in general, consists of training a model on any text dataset, such that the model learns
                        useful patterns from the data. After training for a while, the model starts outputting words that make sense
                        as a standalone entity. LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory) networks have proven to be very effective in this case. 
                        They are capable of remembering the relation among sequences over long distances, which makes them ideal for 
                        text generation. The Keras model I created was trained on the <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> text, which isn't
                        protected under any copyright/license. The model was trained to take as input as sequence of 100 characters, and 
                        predict the next one. Tracing Keras LSTM to Flux LSTM was quite challenging, as they handle input in different 
                        ways. I was able to load the model successfully in Flux and the output, after training for just 15 epochs was pretty
                        decent.<br><br>
                        
                        <pre>
 Original text: went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
        dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a mome

 Produced text: went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
        dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a mome tf the fand,

                        Notice that the output might not make sense, but it was able to produce familiar words, such as <i>she, the
                            on, of, and, an, so
                        </i> etc. from the training text. It is advisable to train the model for at least 25 epochs to get better results.

                        Apart from the mentioned, I also opened an issue in Flux, and created a PR in
                         <a href="https://github.com/JuliaText/TextAnalysis.jl">JuliaText/TextAnalysis.jl</a>, where I added the sentiment 
                         analysis functionality. The PR can be found <a href="https://github.com/JuliaText/TextAnalysis.jl/pull/77">here</a>(W.I.P).
