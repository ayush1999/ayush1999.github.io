                    <p>
                        The past three months have been a great ride, and have filled me with a great deal of excitement,with so much
                        to learn at each and every stage. I got a chance to work with state of the art machine learning models in Computer Vision
                        and Natural Language Processing. The past few months 
                        involved constant coding, debugging, testing and repeating this task again, until proper results were achieved. 
                        I got to learn a lot in this process, about Julia, Flux and Machine 
                        Learning in general. <br><br>
                        I had proposed to work on two packages: ONNX.jl and Keras.jl. I'm glad I was able 
                        to meet the objectives, along with making contributions to other supporting packages in the Flux ecosystem, 
                        such as Flux.jl, MetalHead.jl and TextAnalysis.jl to name a few. In this blog, I'd like to list my work, the PRs that still
                        need some work, and discuss the future of these packages.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">ONNX.jl</h2>
                    <p>
 To know more about ONNX.jl, please refer to my ONNX specific blog post <a href="https://medium.com/@ayush1999/onnx-jl-the-past-present-and-future-d3b497a0cd4c">
 here</a>. The coding period started with working on ONNX.jl. My target for ONNX.jl was to make
                        it good enough to be used to load supported models into Flux. ONNX.jl was pretty much non-existent before, so,
                        I had to write most of it from scratch. Now the main issue here is that the main package, <a href="https://onnx.ai">onnx
                        </a> is itself under development
                        at this stage. I had to keep an eye out for the changes they made in their ecosystem, and how it affected ONNX.jl.
                        Apart from the operators, some of the ONNX models were also not ready for production, but I was able to load a few that
                        showed better results. <br>
                        ONNX.jl can now be used to load and run models efficiently.<br><br>
                        <b>Links to commits:</b><br><br>
                        As I said, I had to write most of the package from scratch, so you can find my commits <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/ONNX.jl/commits/master">here</a>.
                        However, I'd like 
                        to highlight a few major commits. <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><u a href="https://github.com/FluxML/ONNX.jl/commit/f5cb01d3d86e6483bfad56ee383b6e5da8ae0e3e">Adding the ProtoBuf file</a></li>

                        </ul>

                        <br>
                        Apart from this, I also wrote operator tests. In total, I was able to write tests for approximately 125 operators.
                        I also opened a few issues in the main ONNX repository, which highlighted some bugs in models, errors and missing details 
                        in docs. These issues can be found <u a href="https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/created_by/ayush1999">here</u></a>.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Future Work:</b><br><br>
                        As I mentioned, ONNX is under development, so we'd have to keep track of the changes taking place in ONNX and how they
                        could relate to ONNX.jl. Apart from this, operator tests also need to be added as and when they are updated, and also
                        supported by the Flux framework. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The intention behind Keras.jl was to load and run keras models into Flux.
                        I was successfully able to load and run quite a few Keras models using Keras.jl. This involved mapping each Keras layer to 
                        corresponding Flux operator, and converting them into a Julian graph. The models were related to 
                        Computer Vision (ResNet), Natural Language Processing (Text generation, Sentiment Analysis with and without
                        GloVe embeddings), Stock and Bitcoin price prediction.

                    <p>
                        Though most of the code was written by me, I'd like to list a few major commits:<br>

                    <b>Future Work:</b><br><br>
                    Since Keras-TensorFlow is a fairly evolved framework, Flux might need to add support for complicated operators in 
                    the future. The work in Keras.jl remains to update this package with the changes in Flux.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Miscellaneous Contributions:</h2>
                    <p>
                    I added computer vision models, generated by ONNX.jl to the MetalHead.jl. This included 4 models:
                    <ul>
                        <li>SqueezeNet</li>
                        <li>DenseNet</li>
                        <li>ResNet</li>
